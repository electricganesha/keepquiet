# Spy or Die

## Concept
Another year participating in the Global Game Jam has fresh and unforseen results to be proud of : Keep Quiet is an exploration game. She arrives home late, and has to go to bed without waking up the parents. The game was all done in the course of 48h by a team of three people. We used free assets as the team featured no artists, but believe to have achieved an original look-and-feel with our tiny game.

## Tech
Developed in C# using the Unity3D Engine.
